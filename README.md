# REDCap APIs in Python3

_REDCap APIs are provided in Python 2 which will be deprecated in January of 2020.
This repo contains the REDCap API code in python 3. Developers can then tune the code to suite their particular need.
The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/redcap-tools/PyCap)_

## Requirements
> Each file has its requirements but python requests are common in all. For all requirements check **`requirements.txt`** file

## Token and URL
> API token and REDCap url should be filled by the user. They are marked by the place holders **`['api_token_here']`** and **`['api_url_here']`** respectively.

## Notes
> print statements have been used to show the output, but the same is written to a file (json or csv) in the same folder.
